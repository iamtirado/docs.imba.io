# Dom Manipulation And Events

## Dom Events

Javascript can recognize several events. They can be accessed by their attribute name which begins with `on`. Hereâ€™s a list of them.

```ruby
onchange
onclick
onmouseover
ononmouseout
onkeydown
onload #not needed since imba loads on every event.
```

Imba has an extra one that is touch device friendly

```ruby
ontap
```

These events can be used component wide by being setting the handlers at the root level within the tag.

```ruby
tag App
    prop lights default: yes
    def ontap e
        @lights = !lights
    def render
        <self .lightsoff=!@lights>
            if @lights
                <h1> "LIGHTS ON"
            else
                <h1> "LIGHTS OFF"
```

You can pass the event value to a property

```ruby
var state = {
    x: 0, 
    y: 0,
    }
tag App
    def onmousemove e
        state:x = e.x
        state:y = e.y
    def render
        <self>
            <h3> "Your mouse position is {state:x} x {state:y}"
```

## Handler Methods

Itâ€™s better practice to decouple the handler from the view and the event itself. Letâ€™s define a method with the event, and call it from where we need it. There are a few ways to do this, but Imba has a special syntax for this `:click.eventHandlerName`:

We need a method that does our increments: and we have a couple of ways to reference it.

```ruby
tag App
    prop counter
    def increment
        counter++
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click.increment> "+1"
            <button :click="increment"> "plus one"
```

Now we have a couple of event handlers that are outside the view, and we can reference them from within the view:

```ruby
tag App
    prop counter
    def increment
        counter++
    def step amount
        counter += amount
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click.increment> "+1"
            <button :click="increment"> "plus one"
            <button :click=['step',2]> "+2"
            <button :click.step(3)> "+3"
            <p> "total: {counter}"
```

## Inline Handlers

We can use to listen to DOM events and run code when theyâ€™re triggered.

Letâ€™s make an inline event handler. We are going to need to store our state in a variable with a default value of 0:

```ruby
let counter = 0
tag App
    def render
        <self>
            <button> "click"
Imba.mount <App>
```

When we click on the button we want to run some JavaScript that adds +1 to the state.

```ruby
let counter = 0
tag App
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click=(do counter++)> "click"
Imba.mount <App>
```

Now we need to see the total value:

```ruby
let counter = 0
tag App
    prop counter
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click=(do counter++)> "click"
            <p> "total: " + counter
Imba.mount <App>
```

Then we assign an initial value and type for when the component is rendered. Weâ€™ll refer to our state from our component, and give it a default value:

```ruby
Imba.mount <App counter=0>
```

## Inline Handlers

We can also handle the events directly on elements by using inline declarations with `:` instead of using the `on` directive.

```ruby
:change
:click
:mouseover
:onmouseout
:keydown
:tap
```

Inline handlers can go right inline within the elements:

```ruby
tag App
    prop lights default: yes
    def render
        <self .lightsoff=!@lights :tap=(do @lights=!lights)>
            if @lights
                <h1> "LIGHTS ON"
            else
                <h1> "LIGHTS OFF"
```

## Event Modifiers

> ðŸ“ŒNEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED BY SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS JARGON & THE DOM BETTER

DOM event handlers can have modifiers that alter their native behavior. For example `.stop` will stop event from propagating. The modifier is implemented after the event declaration but before the handler. Modifiers can also be chained together using periods.

```ruby
def onsubmit e
    e.prevent.someHandler
<form :submit.prevent.someHandler>
```

```ruby
tag CustomElement    
    def onclick event
        event.target # returns the Imba.Tag target for event
        event.native # returns the native DOMEvent
        event.type # returns the type of event, in this case 'click'
        event.prevent # calls preventDefault on the native event
        event.stop # calls stopPropagation on the native event

        # a bunch of methods accessing native event
        event.x # Event:x
        event.y # event.native:y
        event.button # event.native:button
        event.which # event.native:which
        event.alt # event.native:altKey
        event.shift # shiftKey
        event.ctrl # event.native:ctrlKey
        event.meta # event.native:metaKey
```
